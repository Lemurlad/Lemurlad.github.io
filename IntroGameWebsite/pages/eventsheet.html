<h1 style="text-align:center;">Event Sheet</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">The event sheet is where I code all the actions in my game. Some parts of coding in my event sheet were easy, such as programming the sprites to move when you press the ASWD or arrow keys. Sometimes it was harder, such as when I had to program the score to go up when the ball was kicked into a goal.</p>

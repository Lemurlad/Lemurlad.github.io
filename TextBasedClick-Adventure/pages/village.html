<h4>Villagers and Portals</h4>
<div>You wake up groggily, The hooded stranger comes before and takes off his hood, revealing a strange brown creature with a large nose. He is a member of a group called the villagers, who live in a place called the village. The stranger says he knocked you out because he didn't trust you. You say you just want to get home. Fortunately, you were given a truth serum, so the villagers know this is the truth. The villagers say the only way for you to get home is to walk through one of the portals in the center of the village.
There are 3 portals. A purple portal, a yellow portal, and a blue portal.

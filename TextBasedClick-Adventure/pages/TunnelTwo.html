<h4>A-Door-Able</h4>
<div>You decide to enter the second tunnel. The tunnel leads you to an ancient looking room, where two doors are set in the wall. One made of gold and one made of silver. You then see a strange glowing crystal on in the center of the room. Out of curiosity, you touch it. Upon touching it, you have a vision. From it, you realize one of these doors will lead you to wherever you want to be, and the other, to ruin. Now you are forced to choose.</div>

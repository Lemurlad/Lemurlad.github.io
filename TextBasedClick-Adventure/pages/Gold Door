<h4>Exploring the Ship</h4>
<div>You explore the ship and make your way to the engine room, you find too late a broken wire is sparking near a tank of spilled fuel. You only have seconds to make a decision. You can grab the nearby fire extinguisher, which may or may not be full, run to safety, or try and smother the flames manually with a nearby painting, which according to what the painter told you, was painted with fire resistant paint.</div>
